    image: '/images/projects/smart-irrigation.jpg',
    techStack: ['ESP32', 'Soil Moisture Sensors', 'Relay Module', 'Solar Panel', 'Next.js Dashboard', 'Firebase'],
    problemSolved: 'Farmers in Zambia often over-irrigate or under-irrigate crops due to lack of real-time soil data. This wastes water, reduces crop yield, and increases labor costs. Manual irrigation also requires constant physical presence.',
    systemLogic: 'Soil moisture sensors continuously monitor ground conditions and send data to an ESP32 microcontroller. When moisture drops below a threshold, the system automatically activates water pumps via relay modules. The web dashboard displays real-time moisture levels, pump status, and historical data. The system works offline and syncs when connectivity is available.',
    outcome: 'Reduced water consumption by 40% while improving crop health. Farmers can now monitor and control irrigation remotely, saving 15+ hours of manual labor per week. System deployed on 3 farms in Lusaka region.',

    techStack: ['ESP32', 'L298N Motor Driver', 'DC Motors', 'Web Server', 'HTML/CSS/JS', 'Limit Switches'],
    problemSolved: 'Industrial cutting processes often require manual operation, leading to inconsistent cuts, operator fatigue, and safety hazards. Remote operation capability was needed for hazardous environments.',
    systemLogic: 'ESP32 hosts a local web server accessible via Wi-Fi. The interface provides precise control over cutting mechanisms using PWM signals to the L298N motor driver. Limit switches prevent over-travel. Real-time status feedback is sent to the web interface. Multiple operation modes: manual, semi-auto, and programmed sequences.',
    outcome: 'Achieved 0.5mm cutting precision with full remote control capability. Eliminated direct operator exposure to cutting hazards. Web interface allows operation from any device on the local network.',

    techStack: ['Arduino Mega', 'HC-SR04 Ultrasonic x2', 'Servo Motors', 'Conveyor Belt', 'Relay Module', 'LCD Display'],
    problemSolved: 'Recycling facilities and bottling plants need to sort bottles by size quickly and accurately. Manual sorting is slow, error-prone, and not scalable for high-volume operations.',
    systemLogic: 'Two ultrasonic sensors positioned at different heights detect bottle presence and measure height simultaneously. Arduino processes sensor data to classify bottles into small, medium, and large categories. Servo-actuated gates direct bottles to appropriate collection bins. LCD displays current count and sorting statistics. Conveyor speed adjusts based on throughput.',
    outcome: 'Processes 120+ bottles per hour with 98% classification accuracy. Reduced manual sorting labor by 75%. Currently installed in a local recycling facility, processing 1000+ bottles daily.',

    techStack: ['ESP32', 'Ultrasonic Sensor', 'Temperature Sensor', 'Next.js', 'REST API', 'MQTT', 'Alert System'],
    problemSolved: 'Industrial facilities need continuous monitoring of oil storage tanks. Manual level checks are dangerous, infrequent, and don\'t provide trend data for predictive maintenance. Unexpected shortages cause costly production stops.',
    systemLogic: 'Ultrasonic sensor mounted on tank measures oil level every 30 seconds. ESP32 processes readings, applies temperature compensation, and sends data via MQTT to a cloud broker. Next.js dashboard displays real-time levels, trend charts, and consumption analytics. Automated alerts via email/SMS when levels reach warning thresholds.',
    outcome: 'Zero unexpected oil shortages since deployment. Maintenance team receives advance warning 48+ hours before refill needed. Dashboard adopted by 2 industrial clients for fleet of 12 tanks.',

    problemSolved: 'Visually impaired individuals face challenges detecting obstacles at different heights, including overhead obstructions that traditional canes miss. Existing solutions are expensive or require smartphone connectivity.',
    systemLogic: 'Ultrasonic sensor detects obstacles from ground level up to head height with a 3-meter range. Distance data is converted to haptic feedback via vibration motor - faster vibration means closer obstacle. Audio alerts activate for very close obstacles. All processing happens on-device with no external connectivity required. Rechargeable battery provides 12+ hours of operation.',
    outcome: 'Donated 5 units to Zambia Association for the Blind. Users report 80% improvement in navigation confidence. Battery life exceeds 12 hours. Total build cost under $25 per unit, making it accessible for NGO distribution.',
